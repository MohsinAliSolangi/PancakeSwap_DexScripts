# PancakeSwap-DexScripts

**PancakeSwap-DexScripts** is a comprehensive toolkit that includes various scripts and smart contracts for interacting with PancakeSwap‚Äôs decentralized exchange (DEX). This repository provides features like token swapping, price fetching, liquidity management, market cap calculation, and exchange rate retrieval. It also includes functionality for creating liquidity pools and pairs, along with integrated Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) Oracles for enhanced on-chain randomness.

## Features
- **Swap Tokens**: Automate token swapping using PancakeSwap‚Äôs smart contracts.
- **Price Fetching**: Retrieve real-time token prices from liquidity pools.
- **Liquidity Management**: Add and remove liquidity from pools efficiently.
- **Market Cap & Exchange Rates**: Calculate the market cap and get exchange rates for tokens.
- **Pair Creation**: Automate the creation of liquidity pools and token pairs on PancakeSwap.
- **Chainlink VRF Oracle Integration**: Utilize Chainlink's VRF for secure and provably fair random number generation in smart contracts.
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom-built smart contracts for liquidity, pair creation, and VRF-based randomness, integrated with PancakeSwap.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Hardhat for smart contract testing and deployment.
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC) wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- Chainlink VRF subscription for randomness functionality.
- Access to the BSC Testnet or Mainnet.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MohsinAliSolangi/PancakeSwap_DexScripts.git
    cd PancakeSwap-DexScripts
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Compile the smart contracts:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

### Testing
Run the test scripts to verify functionality:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage
1. **Swapping Tokens**: Use the swap script to exchange tokens on PancakeSwap.
2. **Liquidity Management**: Add or remove liquidity from pools using the liquidity script.
3. **Price & Exchange Rates**: Fetch token prices and exchange rates using the dedicated scripts.
4. **Pair Creation**: Set up new liquidity pairs on PancakeSwap.
5. **Chainlink VRF**: Integrate randomness in your smart contracts using Chainlink VRF.

## Smart Contracts
The `contracts` folder contains smart contracts for:
- Liquidity management and pair creation on PancakeSwap.
- Chainlink VRF integration for on-chain randomness.
